| TALKS | ~ U can haz all my talks
+-------+

Talks can be made with: 

  - Sldz (https://github.com/shrayasr/sldz), The cheesy slides I built for VIM
  - Powerpoint, My favourite so far
  - IPython notebook
  - Keynote, someday!


I mostly make my presentations using Microsoft Powerpoint. If you want the PPTX
files to anything that is here, please do request them over email and I will be
more than glad to send it to you.
